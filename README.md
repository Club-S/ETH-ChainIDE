# ðŸ¤Ÿ ClubS - Create a NFT-masked Club to NFT 



### About

ClubS is a Mobile-First Web3 Social App using Fan Economy Model.
Upon the app-based bbs marketplace we have built, we are developping the service to allow user to create NFT-masked forums, in which only permitted users can create post and comment. 

### What is NFT-masked?
Free knowledge is the basis for equalization and ownership. ClubS is not restricting freedom of knowledge in the name autonomy, so user can view all contents on the platform while the participation in certain discussion may be restricted by the NFT-bar.

## About the contract
The contract serves to mint a Club NFT for a NFT-gated Club. 
- Users who are creating the club are only allowed to set NFT rules within its assets.
- Users who want to join the club for discussion must hold the same NFT.
- Further ideas will be into:
  - Staking NFTs to mint a Club NFT
  - Allow Club NFT to be traded in app
  - Blindbox pre-sale of Club NFT minting rights
  - Club NFT can be display besides username
  - NFT-gated Club could issue fractional Club NFT
  - Club NFT minter can get higher weightage to be the Club Staff
